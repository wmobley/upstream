### Example

* OAuth Authentication (OAuth2PasswordBearer):

```python
import upstream_api_client
from upstream_api_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://localhost
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = upstream_api_client.Configuration(
    host = "http://localhost"

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

configuration.access_token = os.environ["ACCESS_TOKEN"]

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with upstream_api_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = upstream_api_client.UploadfileCsvApi(api_client)
    campaign_id = 56 # int | 
    station_id = 56 # int | 
    upload_file_sensors = None # bytearray | File with sensors.
    upload_file_measurements = None # bytearray | File with measurements.

    try:
        # Post Sensor And Measurement
        api_response = api_instance.post_sensor_and_measurement_api_v1_uploadfile_csv_campaign_campaign_id_station_station_id_sensor_post(campaign_id, station_id, upload_file_sensors, upload_file_measurements)
        print("The response of UploadfileCsvApi->post_sensor_and_measurement_api_v1_uploadfile_csv_campaign_campaign_id_station_station_id_sensor_post:\n")
